58,58,,,,Symmetry,,,,1972,,3 min,16mm; color; silent,,James Browning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Made as a project at Hanover High School (taught by Dale Rowe), the film was made with a Kodak Cine Special, filming off a Graphic-II vector 'scope (developed at Bell Labs in the late 1960s) attached to a Digital Equipment (DEC) PDP-9 mini-computer using Tri-X 16mm film. Browning generated the vector display files using DTSS (Dartmouth Time Sharing System) running on a General Electric 635 Mainframe Computer. He wrote the programs to make the files in Basic, which generated vector (line) files downloaded using an early 9600 baud modem to a PDP-9 mini-computer. He then wrote custom software (PDP- assembly language_ which displayed the vector files on the attached Graphic-II display. The apparent motion within the films comes from “playing” with the 14-inch display monitor with a blue/green phosphor. First the image is displayed with a fast blue-fluorescent phosphor, and then a persistent yellow phosphorescent phosphor continues to display it for several seconds. This makes for a trailing image as the lines are progressively displayed. The motion occurred simply because the display process was deliberately slowed down as the line segments were progressively displayed by the vector 'scope. Shooting on Tri-X, Browning made one print for each of the Red, Green, and Blue images. He sent the three synchronized reels to a printer with instructions to print through Kodak 25 (Red), Kodak 58 (Green) and Kodak 47B Wratten filters onto Ektachrome color reversal 16mm film. Two color prints were produced.",,"Alternative title: Kiewitt, Computer Animation 1",Orphan Film Symposium 2024: Work and Play,Artisanal Computer Animation,Jodie Mack,Dartmouth College,,,,,,,Museum of the Moving Image,,,,
